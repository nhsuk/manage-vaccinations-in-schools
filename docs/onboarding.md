# Onboarding

Onboarding a new organisation involves creating a YAML file containing all the information about the organisation and using the `onboard` Rake task to add everything in to the service.

## Configuration file

```yaml
organisation:
  name: # Unique name of the organisation
  email: # Contact email address
  phone: # Contact phone number
  ods_code: # Unique ODS code
  privacy_policy_url: # Optional privacy policy URL
  reply_to_id: # Optional GOV.UK Notify Reply-To UUID

programmes: [] # A list of programmes, currently only hpv is valid

teams:
  team1: # Identifier to link team with school and links below, not used in app
    name: # Name of the team
    email: # Contact email address
    phone: # Contact phone number

schools:
  team1: [] # URNs managed by a particular team

clinics:
  team1:
    - name: # Name of the clinic
      address_line_1: # First line of the address
      address_town: # Town of the address
      address_postcode: # Postcode of the address
      ods_code: # Unique ODS code
```

An example configuration file used for [the Coventry model office can be found in the repo][coventry-model-office].

[coventry-model-office]: /config/onboarding/coventry-model-office.yaml

## Rake task

Once the file has been written you can use the `onboard` Rake task to set everything up in the service.

```sh
$ bundle exec rails onboard[path/to/configuration.yaml]
```

If any validation errors are detected in the file they will be output and nothing will be processed, only if the file is completely valid will anything be processed.
