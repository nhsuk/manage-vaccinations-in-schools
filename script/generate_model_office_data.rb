# 2. The admin organisation will bulk-upload vaccination records of those children in
# year 9, 10 and 11 who have already been vaccinated in the previous years'
# programmes.
#
# 3. Using Mavis' one record per child model, Mavis will therefore know which
# children from each cohort are already vaccinated, and which are eligible
# for vaccination in this programme
#
# 4. When lead nurses receive the class lists for year 8, 9, 10 and 11 back
# from schools, they will upload these directly into Mavis as cohort records
# (separate uploads by school).
#
# 5. Mavis automatically matches the new records to those already in the
# system, and adds the new parent contact information to existing child
# records where it does not already exist. Where Mavis cannot reliably find
# an exact match to a child, the nurse will be prompted to find the correct
# match manually, or create a new record if the child is new to the area.
#
# 6. Records for any children who were previously thought to be in that
# school but weren't on the class list will be flagged to the nurse to be
# moved to the "unknown school" list.
#
# 7. Once the class lists are uploaded for a given school, the lead nurse can
# add a new school session, select the school and select that HPV will be the
# only vaccination type available. The nurse will then see a list of all
# eligible children from all active programs who have not yet had the HPV
# vaccination, to add them to the school session.
