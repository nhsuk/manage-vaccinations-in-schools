# Record childrens vaccines -- Prototype

This is a service for recording children vaccinations with the NHS. This version
is a prototype used for testing service designs and implementation technology.

# Development

## Prerequisites

This project depends on:

  - [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
  - [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
  - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
  - [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

The instructions below assume you are using `asdf` to manage the necessary
versions of the above.

## Application architecture

We keep track of architecture decisions in [Architecture Decision Records
(ADRs)](/adr/).

We use `rladr` to generate the boilerplate for new records:

```bash
bin/bundle exec rladr new title
```

## Development toolchain

### asdf

This project uses `asdf`. Use the following to install the required tools:

```sh
# The first time
brew install asdf # Mac-specific
asdf plugin add ruby
asdf plugin add nodejs
asdf plugin add yarn
asdf plugin add postgres

# To install (or update, following a change to .tool-versions)
asdf install
```

When installing the `pg` gem, bundle changes directory outside of this
project directory, causing it lose track of which version of postgres has
been selected in the project's `.tool-versions` file. To ensure the `pg` gem
installs correctly, you'll want to set the version of postgres that `asdf`
will use:

```sh
# Temporarily set the version of postgres to use to build the pg gem
ASDF_POSTGRES_VERSION=13.5 bundle install
```

### Library dependencies

#### Bundle

Run `bundle install` to install gem dependencies.

#### Yarn

Run `yarn` to install node dependencies.

### Linting

To run the linters:

```bash
bin/lint
```
### Intellisense

[solargraph](https://github.com/castwide/solargraph) is bundled as part of the
development dependencies. You need to [set it up for your
editor](https://github.com/castwide/solargraph#using-solargraph), and then run
this command to index your local bundle (re-run if/when we install new
dependencies and you want completion):

```sh
bin/bundle exec yard gems
```

You'll also need to configure your editor's `solargraph` plugin to
`useBundler`:

```diff
+  "solargraph.useBundler": true,
```
### PostgreSQL

The script `bin/db` is included to start up PostgreSQL for setups that don't use
system-started services, such as `asdf` wwhich is our default. Note that this is
meant to be a handy script to manage PostgreSQL, not run a console like `rails db`
does.

```
$ bin/db
pg_ctl: no server running
$ bin/db start
waiting for server to start.... done
server started
$ bin/db
pg_ctl: server is running (PID: 79113)
/Users/misaka/.asdf/installs/postgres/13.5/bin/postgres
```

This script attempts to be installation agnostic by relying on `pg_config` to
determine postgres's installation directory and setting up logging accordingly.

### Database setup

Setup the DB the standard way for a Rails app:

``` bash
rails db:setup
rails db:migrate
```

### Development server

This application comes with a `Procfile.dev` for use with `foreman` in
development environments. Use the script `bin/dev` to run it:

``` bash
$ bin/dev
13:07:31 web.1  | started with pid 73965
13:07:31 css.1  | started with pid 73966
13:07:31 js.1   | started with pid 73967
...
```

### Testing

This application comes with Cypress BDD tests. To run the tests use:

``` bash
yarn cypress run
```

Or open the Cypress app to interactively run the tests:

``` bash
yarn cypress open
```
