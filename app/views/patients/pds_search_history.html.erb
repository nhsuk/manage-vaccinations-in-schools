<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Terms used in this lookup</h2>

<p class="nhsuk-u-reading-width">A fuzzy search finds text that matches a term closely as well as exactly. 
  For example, a fuzzy search can identify Jon Smith even if the term entered was John Smith.</p>

<p class="nhsuk-u-reading-width">A wildcard searches for unknown parts of text. For example, if you only 
  have part of a postcode: CV1, you can use a wildcard to search all records with a postcode 
  that includes CV1.</p>

<p class="nhsuk-u-reading-width">History refers to the childâ€™s history, for example if they have changed 
  their name or address.</p>
