<%= h1 "Accessibility statement", size: "xl" %>

This accessibility statement applies to the Give or refuse consent for vaccinations and Manage vaccinations in schools services.

We want as many people as possible to be able to use the service. This means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser functionality
- zoom in up to 400 per cent without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the service using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the service using speech recognition software
- interact with most of the service using a screen reader (including recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We also try to make our content as simple as possible to understand.

If you have a disability, search AbilityNet for guides on how to make your device easier to use.
