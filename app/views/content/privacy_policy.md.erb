<%= h1 "Privacy policy", size: "xl" %>

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy covers what personal information we collect, and how we use, share, and store it.

## Who we are

The Manage vaccinations in schools service (Mavis) is run by NHS England for the purpose of managing vaccinations in schools.

## What personal information we collect

When inviting expressions of interest from parents, we collect:

- parent or guardian’s name
- parent or guardian’s email address

## How long we store personal information

All data collected will be deleted within two months of the last vaccination session arranged as part of the pilot.

## Where personal information is stored

Data is stored in the United Kingdom. All data held within Manage vaccinations in schools (Mavis) is within the UK jurisdiction, as it is hosted in the ‘Europe (London) region’ on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## How we protect personal information

The Mavis service follows existing best practices and adheres to the [principles set out in the NCSC’s Cloud security guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles). It is deployed to the NHS’s AWS estate, following NHS England’s guidance, and has been penetration tested.

Specific security controls will include but are not limited to:

- **Protection of data in transit.** Use of modern and secure TLS version will be enforced when connecting to the system.

- **Data encryption.** Data will be encrypted before being written to non-volatile storage.

- **Physical location and jurisdiction.** All resources will be created within the “Europe (London) region” to ensure all data and processing happens in the UK.

- **Physical resilience and availability.** The system will have redundancy built-in and regular data backups.

- **Separation between customers.** Role and organisation-based access controls will be implemented. Session and patient data belong to organisations and user access is based on organisation membership.

- **Vulnerability management.** Automated scanning for old or vulnerable dependencies will be implemented, both at the higher system level and the lower operating-system level.

- **Protective monitoring.** The system will be monitored for errors and malicious behaviour using activity and error logging services.

- **Incident management.** An incident management process will be established and documented before the pilot is started.

- **Configuration and change management.** Changes to the system will go through a peer review before being deployed, include hosting configuration which will be defined as code and version controlled.

- **Secure development.** Changes to the code base will be cryptographically signed. A suite of automated tests will be run for every code change. These include static code analysis to ensure no secrets have been accidentally committed, and that the code follows best practices for security.

## Who the data controllers are

NHS England is the sole controller for the details of parents who have consented to take part in the pilot in relation to providing shopping vouchers as thank-yous.

## Your rights

You can:

- find out what information we hold about you, ask us to correct it if it’s wrong, or delete it by emailing <enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk>
- contact the Information Commissioner’s Office, Wycliffe House Water Lane, Wilmslow SK9 5AF if you want to make a complaint about how we’ve managed your data

## Our legal basis for using personal information

Under Section 13E(1)(a) and (b) of the NHS 2006 Act, NHS England can exercise its functions with a view to securing continuous improvement in connection with preventing, diagnosing or treating illness, and protecting or improving public health.
