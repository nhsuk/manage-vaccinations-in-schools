##
# This class is used to update the patient-team associations for any
# particular set of patients or teams. Patient-team associations are a cache
# of which teams have access to view which patients, and the logic depends on
# a number of associated tables. For example, a patient is considered part of
# a team if they have an archive reason, or vaccination record for that team.
#
# A `patient_scope` and `team_scope` can be passed in to limit the scope of
# which patients and teams get updated. Without these arguments the default
# is to update all the patients and teams.
#
# If a patient or team scope is provided which has just a where clause on the
# ID (for example `Patient.where(id: 10)`), the class will attempt an
# optimisation which avoids a join and instead filters directly on the ID in
# the relation.
#
# The updater works by executing two queries. The first query is a bulk update
# using `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` to update all the patient-team
# associations by setting the array of sources for each association. The
# sources array contains all the possible reasons why a patient might be
# associated with a team (for example `archive_reason` or
# `vaccination_record_organisation`). The second query deletes any rows from
# the table where the sources array is empty (meaning the patient should not
# belong to the team.).
